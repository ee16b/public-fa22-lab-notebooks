    "Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) and Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are some of the most commonly used circuits today. They can be found in a wide variety of electronics, such as microcontrollers like the Arduino we use in class, computers, phones, thermostats, etc. This is because our computers and chips process information from the real world that must be stored digitally, while the information that we gather is itself an analog value. DACs and ADCs play a very important role in the electronics we use everyday, and in this lab, we will be exploring how to build our own simple DAC and ADC.\n",
