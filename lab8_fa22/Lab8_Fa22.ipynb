    "In the previous lab, we developed a closed-loop controller to make the car go straight. However, we also want the car to be able to turn! In this lab, we will modify the control scheme from Lab 7 to enable the car to turn. For a refresher on our closed-loop controller, please refer to the Controls Part 1 lab note [here](https://eecs16b.org/lab/notes/lab_note7.pdf). There is no lab note for Lab 8: everything you need is in this notebook!"

    "### **We have been turning during Closed-Loop Control!**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get a clue about turning by considering how we implemented closed-loop control. We perform feedback control to minimize the difference between the two wheels ($\\delta[i] = d_L[i] - d_R[i]$). When perturbations cause one wheel to get ahead of the other, the result is a non-zero $\\delta$, causing feedback control to turn the car to correct the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our feedback control policy is: \n",
    "$$u_L[i] = u_L^{OL} - \\frac{f_L}{\\theta_L}\\delta[i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_R[i] = u_R^{OL} + \\frac{f_R}{\\theta_R}\\delta[i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the right wheel has moved further than the left ($d_R[i] > d_L[i]$), resulting in a negative $\\delta[i]$. A negative $\\delta[i]$ results in a reduction of $u_R[i]$, and an increase of $u_L[i]$. But what does this mean physically?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the right wheel is getting ahead of the left one, the left wheel will need to move a little faster and the right wheel a little slower for the wheels to even back out. Thus, feedback control corrects errors by turning to compensate for them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So we know that $\\delta \\ne 0$ can be used to turn the car. What if we artificially modified our $\\delta[i]$ values to make the car think it was turning?"

    "### **Turning via reference tracking**\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn, we will manually add some $\\delta_{ref}$ to our $\\delta$ value at each step of the control scheme. By doing so, we are tricking our control scheme into thinking that our car has turned by some amount to generate that extra $\\delta_{ref}$ of error, causing it to turn in the opposite direction to compensate. When making a turn, the magnitude of $\\delta$ grows because otherwise, the car is driving straighter. Therefore, we need to update $\\delta_{ref}$ at each timestep to ensure that the car continues to turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, we'll analyze a right turn, corresponding to adding a **negative** $\\delta_{ref}$ value (the car thinks it's turned left, so it tries to turn right). Our goal is to generate this $\\delta_{ref}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like the car to turn with a specified radius $r$ and linear velocity $v^*$. The controller's unit for distance is encoder ticks, but each tick is approximately 1 cm of wheel circumference. Additionally, we want our car to turn gradually (rather than making a pivot turn), so $\\delta_{ref}$ will be a function of the controller's time-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the following variables:\n",
    "- $i$ [time] - timestep\n",
    "- $r$ [cm] - turn radius of the center of the car; 1 cm $\\approx$ 1 encoder tick\n",
    "- $d$ [tick] - distance traveled by the center of the car\n",
    "- $l$ [cm] - distance between the centers of the wheels; 1 cm $\\approx$ 1 encoder tick\n",

    "### Sampling periods \n",
    " \n",
    " Our implementations of data collection and control loop have different time periods: data collection collected data on half-second intervals, while our controller updates the trajectory every 0.1 seconds. This means that our controller will be running at a faster rate than our data collection. However, our definition of the time step is dependent on the sampling period we use, so we will need to account for this difference by adjusting $v^*$ in our implementation of turning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the sampling periods of the control loop and the data collection be $T_c$ and $T_d$, which have the units $\\frac{s}{sample}$. Therefore,their respective sampling frequencies $F_c = \\frac{1}{T_c}$ and $F_d = \\frac{1}{T_d}$ have the units $\\frac{samples}{s}$. We define $m=\\frac{F_c}{F_d}$, the ratio of the sampling frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our controller will interpret velocity in terms of distance traveled (measured in encoder ticks) per sample ($\\frac{ticks}{sample}$). However, we need to ensure the car is travelling at the same ground velocity, which is measured per second ($\\frac{ticks}{s}$). To get a constant $\\frac{ticks}{s}$, we need $v^*_c \\cdot F_c = v^* \\cdot F_d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $v^*_c$, we get $v^*_c = v^* \\cdot \\frac{F_d}{F_c} = \\frac{v^*}{m}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in our values of $T_c=100ms$ and $T_d=500ms$, we can calculate that $F_c=10$, $F_d=2$, and $m=5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example:$\\\\$\n",
    "During data collection, we sampled every $.5$ seconds. If our v* was collected to be $100$ ticks/sample, this means that we expect our car to move $100$ ticks every $.5s$ (assuming constant velocity). Now, our controller's sampling rate is instead $.1$ seconds. If we use the same v* of $100$ ticks/sample, we are now expecting our car to move $100$ ticks in $.1s$, effectively quintupling our velocity! Our controller does not have information about the original sampling period; to account for this, we divide $v^*$ by $5$ when using a $v^*$ value for turning.\n",

However, some cars may still turn very slightly even when both encoder measurements are exactly the same ($\\delta=constant$).
